They can be quite large as they are pretrained transformers for NLP (working on reducing the size)

# What this is 
This uses a few ML models along with some naive human-made NLP features to attempt to scrape a day's tweets for newly announced startups. It's built with snscrape and generates a .txt file with â‰¤100 URLs and tweets from 24 to 48 hours ago. 

# To use: 
Run the get_tweets.py. 
It takes around ~30 minutes to pull and run the model, with most of the time being taken up by the ML classifiers and transformers.
